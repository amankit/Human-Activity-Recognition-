This project is about predicting Human activity based on the data collected using smartphone's sensors.
You can read about the dataset from the HAR_EDA.ipynb file.

I have done this project by using Two techniques i.e. Machine Learning  and Deep learning.

In this project, First I used classical machine learning in which I used Features given by domain experts. Linear SVM and RBF Kernel based SVM gives good results. You can see this in HAR_ClassicalML.ipynb file.

Second, I used Deep Learning i.e. simple LSTM based Architecture in which i feed raw time series data. And It gives me nice results. You can see this in HAR_LSTM.ipynb file.
